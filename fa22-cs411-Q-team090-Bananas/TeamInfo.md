## Project Summary

Using a few datasets, we want to combine databases and create tables that allow for easy and fast used car lookup. The point of this database is to help lookup cars that the customer wants with car specifications that they are looking for. After they input the car specifications, The database will be able to output a car or cars that are suitable for the customer. These cars will not always be the exact car the customer is looking for, however it will be a car that is very similar to what the customer wants.
